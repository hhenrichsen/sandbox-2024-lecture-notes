  to scale
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) - Another infrastructure provider that
  isn't as complex as AWS

  proxies that allow you to make `localhost` available to the internet
- [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) -
  backend-as-a-service that let you focus on building features (Also, if you're
