### Events and Announcements

_I mostly know about Lucid events, but feel free to slack me a day or two before
class and I can get things added here._

- Lucid Tech Talk - September 11th. Come hear from me and Alex Blackburn about
  how and why Lucid built a developer platform and API.

### News

_In the future, this will be a segment where we talk about things that are going
on in the tech space that are worth knowing about. Please slack a link to a news
article about it after you get called on._

## Intro

### Introducing Hunter

Howdy, I'm Hunter. I'm 25, and a Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead at Lucid
Software. Some other interesting (or uninteresting) trivia about me:

- I'm the oldest of 6 boys
- I grew up in Connecticut
- I help maintain
  [motion-canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas) and spend too
  much time writing random components for it
- I've been programming since I was 14, but didn't take it seriously until I was
  17 or 18 for a robotics class
- The first time I felt like a real programmer was when I built a webapp that
  let the Humans vs Zombies club at USU track their game of infection tag
- I'm building a new version of it at https://hvz.gg for the next little while
  to help the club be able to not run the old site (which I hate working in)
  anymore
- I'm not sure what project I'm going to be building with y'all this semester;
  I'm open to suggestions, but will probably end up writing some kind of note
  taking software

Please call me Hunter.

I use a combination of VSCode, IntelliJ (and variants), and Vim to write my
code. I tend to go really quickly in demos because that's how I normally work,
so please ask me questions to slow me down. I'm trying to go a little bit slower
and introduce things at a higher level, but your help here is appreciated.

### Classroom Technology

This semester, I'm going to be using a couple of tools to help me run the class.
The primary ones are [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) (makes it easier to not
lose questions), [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com) (diagrams), and
[Lucidspark](https://lucidspark.com) (brainstorming). Some class activities (and
participation) will be done through these. To that end, I recommend joining
today's Slido and entering your name so I can count you for participation today.

## Priorities of a Startup

### Speed

At a startup, one of the things that you have to do well is build, learn, and
adapt quickly. As an engineer, that means that you need to set up an environment
where you can make changes quickly, and see the results. I have two main points
of advice here that are relevant starting out:

1. Speed means testing. There is no way to learn this better than by breaking
   things, but the ideal process is moving fast without breaking things. To me,
   that means you need ways to make sure that things are not broken, like unit
   and integration tests. I will have dedicated lectures on this, but making the
   effort early--especially around some of the critical flows that you are going
   to be writing early on--will have exponential returns in the future.
2. Speed means measuring. You should not waste development effort on flows that
   few users are going to use. You should not waste effort trying to make things
   faster that are rarely called. In order to determine what flows users are
   using, what flows aren't performing well, you need metrics. This is likely a
   second semester topic, but this is another thing that if you invest in early,
   it will pay dividends down the line.
3. Speed means working in an environment that encourages you to build features.
   If you are consistently fighting with a part of (or even the whole) tech
   stack, or spending more time building abstractions than features, it may be
   time to invest in a new one that encourages you to work more quickly.

I encourage you to build your apps in such a way that the above are respected,
as well as writing your code in a way that can work well. There is lots of
design advice out there on how to write clean code. Don't waste time by writing
code quickly.

### Scale

The whole goal of a startup is to acquire users. More users mean more problems,
more features, and more server load, however.

This warrants its own lecture, maybe multiple. There are lots of ways to deal
with this, from increasing the number of servers or services available, to
caching more frequently, to proactively computing things commonly computed
together.

### Onboarding

Eventually, you will want to enlist the help of another engineer, or pass the
project off to another engineer. I'm going to call this process "Onboarding".
Your ability to do this quickly an effectively should be a priority, and efforts
you make little by little will be worth it when it comes time to bring another
person up to speed.

Writing documentation and keeping design documents and records of decisions is
important. Up-to-date system documentation does wonders for getting new
engineers up to speed on what all the moving parts are and where in the codebase
they would need to go to make a change. These should also include:

- Clear steps on how to get a development version of the site working
- What steps need to happen to get a change into production
- What standards need to be followed? Do tests need to be written before code is
  merged?
- Any contractual obligations you have--do you need specific accessibility
  requirements before code goes to production? What about security or
  certification?

One of the other things you can be doing day-to-day is doing good project
management. That means keeping good records of what has been done and what needs
to be done. That means keeping track of deadlines and what features need to be
released together, or which work blocks other work.

## Project Management

### Stories / Issues / Tickets

Stories, issues or tickets are the fundamental units of work in project
management. These are the simple tasks that make everything else up. Generally
larger than a commit, but as small a task that can generally be described.

Examples:

- Add google sign in option to authentication
- Allow storing and querying user subscription level
- Allow users to join and leave games

You will want to work with your team to get these designed and fleshed out in
advance.

### Projects / Epics

Projects or epics are the larger units of work. These are the larger units of
work and are generally made up of stories.

Example:

- Game Management -- allow users to create, join, leave, and administer games.
  Games should allow joining via invitation links, or by searching in a public
  directory.

### Tech Debt

Sometimes in the effort to develop something quickly, you will need to make a
sacrifice in terms of quality. I recommend that you file these as their own
stories, perhaps in their own epic or bucket as tech debt. That way you have a
record and can address these as you go, rather than allowing it to pile up and
eventually cause larger issues.

Tech Debt means that you're moving quick enough to make progress. That doesn't
mean avoiding it at all costsâ€“that means you're going too slow! Recording it
strikes a balance of noting that a decision of both priority and implementation
has been made, one that allows you to move forward for now while keeping track
of the cost.

## Code Management

### Git Branch Management

Generally, I keep a couple branches on my projects. I keep a `main` branch that
runs on production (once it builds and tests successfully), a `develop` branch
that contains changes that are near production ready but aren't quite there yet,
and any number of branches for individual features. I'll merge `develop` into
`main` when I want to do a deploy (until I'm satisfied enough with my testing
and CI / CD to merge directly from a feature to `main`).

This way I can PR my changes as a cohesive unit, and then anyone else on my team
can code review it.

### Code Review

Here's a comment from one of your precursors from last year:

> "We didn't start doing code review for a little while, but it was really
> useful when we did start doing it. Not that I was catching issues in other
> people's code, but I was seeing what was being worked on and the changes going
> out".

I've found the biggest benefit is like this person saysâ€“by doing code review,
each engineer is more aware of the current state of the codebase and what
features are available.

I have a whole checklist of things that I go through when reviewing code; things
like backwards compatibility, deploy order, potential bugs, naming /
documentation improvements, and similar things are all things that I look for.
If I can ask for that investment (or put the time in to fix things that others
ask for), I've found that I'm the person that benefits most from that in the
long run.

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good, however:

> In general, reviewers should favor approving a CL once it is in a state where
> it definitely improves the overall code health of the system being worked on,
> even if the CL isnâ€™t perfect.

[Standard of Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html).

### Tests

I write tests for two reasons:

1. It lets me refactor my code
2. It lets me merge without manually testing every code path

Early on, it's probably only worth investing in for core flows; log in,
onboarding, etc., to make sure that those work for prospective new users.

Later on, automated testing is what eventually allows you to do automatic
releases. Lucid used to do weekly or sprintly releases, prior to which the QA
team would do a whole suite of manual regression tests. Doing these manually
sucks. Having automation makes it easier.

The other benefit I find from testing is that automated tests force me to write
more modular code. If a test can't set up my function in a way to isolate it and
reuse it, it's unlikely that any other area of my codebase can do so.

## High Level Overview

### Common Elements

Most apps will have many of the following components:

- Authentication
- Database
- Backend
- Frontend
- Email
- Observability
- Notifications
- Background Jobs

If you're still looking for an idea, I recommend tackling these features in the
meantime. These will give you some building blocks in your toolbox to use when
you do find something to pursue.

### Common Architectures

Some of the most common architectures that I hear talked about are:

- Monolith
- Service-Oriented
- Microservices
- Serverless

Each has benefits and drawbacks. Monoliths are straightforward to understand and
make changes to, but scale in unison.

Service-oriented allows to scale individual components, but requires additional
complexity around sharding and load balancing.

Microservices can be fully independent modules, but requires understanding your
domain in such a way that you can break it into fully independent modules. Most
people and teams do not start with this understanding.

Serverless keeps infrastructure simple and allows scaling easily, but locks you
into vendors and can end up being more expensive than a regular server.

## Random Advice

### Choosing a Tech Stack

Lucid started out using CakePHP and now uses a much more complex stack with
Angular and Scala. Choose something you can work quickly in. I tend to use a 50%
rule for picking a project's stack:

No more than 50% of combined framework, and scope can be net new.

For example, if I'm learning a new language or framework, I have to build
something that I've built before to focus on learning that new framework more
fully.

Or, if I'm building a brand new project, I do best if I work in a language and
framework that I'm familiar with. One thing to be cautious of when doing this,
however, is that hiring engineers for niche frameworks is harder than getting
someone into a codebase using a popular language. There's a steeper onboarding
process there, so sometimes fronting the cost of learning something popular can
pay off when you get to the point of needing more help.

### Infrastructure

Start with something simple, like a server or two on a cloud provider. Scale up
to more complex things as needed, but not because it's what everyone else is
doing.

If Vercel + Neon meets your needs, why migrate to something more complex and
costly? Most decisions can be changed later (although vendor lock-in is a real
problem to be aware of).

### Chasing Trends

There are a lot of buzzwords and trends that get tossed around that I think end
up making building things way more confusing than they need to be.

- I've watched SSR come and go at least once.
- Native apps and web apps have traded at least once as well.
- NFTs and Crypto got big and then have been much quieter.
- Microservices get talked about a lot and then rarely implemented.

On the other hand, some things that were rarely talked about have become really
important and useful to my own workflows:

- Containers are super useful, and I don't want to imagine working without them.
- CI / CD have made it way easier for me to ship features in my own projects and
  at work confidently.

What I don't want to say is don't follow a promising trend. But also don't
follow someone else's idea of "the right way" without pondering it yourself.
